## Team

- Ellis Yoo
- Lydia Minehan-Tubic
- Fizzo Pannosch
- Audrey Patterson

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

  - Audrey: Really good at google, team player
  - Lydia: Organized, process oriented, planner, project management
  - Fizzo: artistic! sales communicating in the moment - good at what he knows!
  - Ellis: Debugging, good at googling and finding the answers!

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

  - Lydia is the cat herder
  - All of our strengths in certain coding aspects seem to mesh well together
  - Ellis debugging skills will come in when we hit roadblocks

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  - Daily standups
  - Mob programming/pair programming
  - Daily check-in at the end of the day - just to make sure we're still on track

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - Bring in a 3rd party to help as a moderator
  - Bring up when there is tension
  - Split up and take a break/breather when there is tension
  - Let's have each other's backs - we are in this together!
  - Genuine apologies! Wipe the slate clean and move on..

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - We are all collaborative - check your egos!
  - Don't interfer in other's work
  - If you feel like you aren't getting to contribute, speak up and ask to pair program
  - If you are feeling motivated to work on things after hours or outside of the group knowing, then make sure you communicate with the team

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Leave no man behind, pair program if needed

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Discuss this during standups and try to find something that they might be comfortable contributing to
  - If you are struggling, voice it to the group

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - Bring in a 3rd party - TA, Brian
  - Need an unbias take on issues
  - If walking away doesn't work, or if splitting up for a moment, then escalate

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - Working in Remo - 9-5p
  - And if we are motivated we will do some night programming

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack - 100%
  - Email as a fallback
  - Hop in remo to chat or talk things through

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Problem solving and talk about what are we stuck on?
  - Come together as a group and talk it out
  - Tips on not falling behind
   - do the tasks that are the trickiest things first
   - take on the big todo's off first

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - After hours - could hop into Remo to night program
  - Weekend will be R&D and can be brought to the group on Monday
  - Just keep eachother in the loop and check-in with the group before you make any big jumps on the project

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Morning standup and evening check-in - everyone should speak, even if you don't really have anything to add.
  - Just be respectful

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - Our group feels safe already!

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - Through our GitHub projects board
  - Morning standup to start assigning tasks or grabbing tasks that need to be done

- What project management tool will be used?
  - GitHub Projects

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - All code
  - Project Outline
  - Project Readme

- How will you share the repository with your team?
  - Use an Organization to house all reps

- What is your Git flow?
  - Dev branch will be the "main" branch and then we'll branch off of Dev with our own feature branches

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

- How many people must review a PR?
  - Need approval for merges to Dev and to Main
  - At least 2 people to approve merges
  - Pull from Main in the morning!
- Who merges PRs?
  - The group
- How often will you merge?
  - Merge to Dev in the evening and then merge to Main
- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  - Slack - plan for evening merges, but can stop as a group if we need to merge in the middle of the day
